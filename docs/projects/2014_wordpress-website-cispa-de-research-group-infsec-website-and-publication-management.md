In order to have a modernized amd maintainable website for CISPA and the research groups as well, a new website
infrastructure was set up, based on a Wordpress MultiSite install and a popular plugin (teachPress).
The plugin was forked and extended to better suite the needs of CISPA (e.g. manage more artifact types and 
have a common artifact DB for all sites of the MultiSite install).
