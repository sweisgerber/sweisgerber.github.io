As we needed to automate the evaluation of CISPA's publication statistics,
we needed more metadata in the existing ePrints system. The solution was to extend ePrints 
with a conference, journal and conference/journal-ranking system and a few more custom fields
to represent the internal and external structure at CISPA as well.
