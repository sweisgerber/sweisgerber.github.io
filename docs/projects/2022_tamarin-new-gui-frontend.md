A React and TypeScript based dynamic graph render library and user interface for the Tamarin-Prover.
During development there was a huge focus on rendering the SVG-based graph in a performant way, to keep the re-render 
count small.

The UI was of course automatically built and deployed to a staging kubernetes cluster for testing and accessibility by
the product team.

> No source-code has been published yet. The new Tamarin GUI Frontend will get released shortly.
