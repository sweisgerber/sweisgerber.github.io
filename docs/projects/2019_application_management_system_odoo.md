As CISPA needed an Application management system, which respected the specialized hiring work-flow in academia,
we needed to develop a system which implemented this work-flow.

After an extensive research phase, we chose [odoo](https://www.odoo.com) as base system and implemented an application
management extension for it, in order to fullfill the requirements.
This was a Python project, that stretched over a few months and the implementation was quite fun. With such a high-level
language and odoo as a basis, the implementation of the business logic was a breeze.
